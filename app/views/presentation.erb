<!-- 
Technology:
Rails-API backend
Sinatra frontend
fully decoupled
D3
HTML5
CSS3
ECMAScript 6 (JS6)
APIs: Weather Underground, Forecast.io
jQuery


Team Dynamics:
Picture of team
pair programming on major sections
stand ups 3x per day, kept short
communication
comfort with pivoting on direction


Successes:
Fully decoupled
Using large data sets, caching them on the frontend
Kept up response time with minimal AJAX calls
learning D3 from scratch
Minimal user input, maximum output


Hurdles:
API issues:
tried several different APIs, found that WU and FC.io to be best option
Daily limits to API calls and data completeness
Pulling in 5 years worth of data and crushing it down to pertinent info
learning D3 from scratch
pivoting on frontend - REACT, then NODE/EMBER, then SINATRA
Difficulty with Agile dev, since some steps needed completion before other steps could be begun.


Next Steps:
More cities
More robust data from more complete APIs
Flesh out original plan for feels like: smells, look, sounds, tastes
More advanced D3 graph visualizations -->
